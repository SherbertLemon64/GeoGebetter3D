# GeoGebetter
The name is a play on words of GeoGebra, I was a bit dissapointed with the performance of GeoGebra 3d version, so I tried making a program with a similar featureset in OpenTK

# Getting it to work
You should just need .net core 5 and the OpenTK library, If I put any more changes on this project I will upload a precompiled version


---
# Commits
yeah, shush, I know all of this up to now has been done in two commits, I programmed it in a quick go so I didn't use much source control.

# Credits

Any code which isn't mine is either "borrowed" from the LearnOpenTK page or the helpful people on the OpenTK server, any code which isn't mine should have credits to who it is from
